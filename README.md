# CATALYST

## Executive Summary

Vital Point AI (NEAR Guild) is building Catalyst - a DAOaaS with social/community features on NEAR.  Targeting non-technical users interested in exploring how a DAO (without knowing what a DAO is) can help them build and nurture a loyal community around a common cause.  Already Included or on the roadmap:
* Base DAO configurations that are customizable by DAO proposal
* Integrated with NEAR wallet
* Ability to build personas (decentralized identity) around a NEAR account that can then interact as that persona with DAOs of choice
* DAO discoverability - makes it easy for people to find and participate in DAOs based on interest, values, beliefs
* Everything occurs in app using decentralized technologies (i.e, Ceramic network (IDX), NEAR, IPFS)
* Ability to build up reputation value via DAO specific fungible tokens (tradeable) (social tokens) (to come0)
* DAO specific NFT capabilities (to come)
* DAO staking (to come)

Our goal is to **provide a platform with open web/web 3.0 functionality that feels like the Web 2.0 applications** people are used to using.  NEAR makes that possible.

* when each modular component reaches suitable state of functionality, Vital Point AI intends to use them as projects in educational material on Vital Point Academy to assist with growing the number of developers building on NEAR using AssemblyScript.

* Any contracts automatically become composable parts of the NEAR ecosystem, to be used according to the specifications in the contract (e.g., did registry)

* would suggest the end-state of this project will bring new users to the NEAR ecosystem - not because they want to build a DAO - but because it's going to solve the problems they are having managing their communities in a unique and very open web way.
